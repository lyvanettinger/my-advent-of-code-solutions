# my-advent-of code solutions
My bare bones and mostly naive solutions to some advent of code puzzles (without inputs)
Can see some progress over the years!

## 2025
Picked up these puzzles again as something to do on my daily 1 + 1 hour train commutes :)
Learned some basic regex to aid in solving some puzzles (mostly for reading data)
